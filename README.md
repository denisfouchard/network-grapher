# Network grapher

This is a simple network grapher that uses the [NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io/) library to generate a graph of the network. It uses the [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) library to draw the graph.

This project is aimed at familiarizing myself with the NetworkX library and argument parsing in Python.

## Usage

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
```
python main.py [-h] [-s] [-p] file output
```
